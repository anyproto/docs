# Can pages be nested one to another?

Let's look at an example:

> * I have object A.

Answer: **they both starting to have links to each other**.

We have <mark style="background-color:red;">no nesting</mark> for [object](../fundamentals/object/ "mention"). So object doesn't physically include/store different objects.

All Anytype structure based on linking between objects. Links are directional, so you know that page A links to → page B. You can link in the opposite way if you need that. You can't use classical hierarchy when files belong to folders and folders create a path. But you can make some of the objects Favourite so that they will be accessible straight from Home.&#x20;

All objects connections will soon look like an interconnected network:
