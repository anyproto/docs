# Properties

Properties are key to organizing and connecting your Objects and knowledge in Anytype. There are two functions that Properties serve in Anytype:

* **Defining attributes:** You can use Properties to define the characteristics of a certain Object.
  * For example, when creating a Task in Anytype, you can add Properties such as _Status_: Done/Not Done, or _Priority_: Low, Medium, or High.
  * If we were to imagine a database, Properties represent the column headers to each row (where column A represents the Object name, and where each row represents an Object).
  * Once you have set your attributes, it becomes possible to sort and filter your Objects according to the Properties you've defined in your Query.
* **Defining connections:** You can also use Properties to link one Object to another.
  * Returning to the example of a Task, you can add the Property: _Linked Projects,_ and connect another Object in your Anytype to this task.
  * As above, you can view the Linked Projects as Properties in a Query, or in your Graph.

### Create a New Property

#### Creating Properties from the Type Edit Menu

While editing any [Type in your Space settings](./#creating-types-from-space-settings), you can use the `+` button in the top right corner of the Properties section to either add an existing property to the current Type or to create a new one.&#x20;

#### Creating Properties from Space Settings

Open your [space.md](../install-and-setup/space.md "mention") settings, and navigate to `Content Model > Properties`. Afterwards, simply click on `New` button to create a new Property.

From here, you can choose a name and a type for your new Property.

If you've decided that this Property is no longer relevant, you can use the context menu (mouse right-click) to delete the Property from your space.

#### Creating Properties from the Object Editor

You can add a Property to your Objects as you would with any other block in the editor: by using the `+` button or the in-line `/` menu.

Any Property you create from the object editor will be available for editing in your space settings using the steps above.

#### Types of Properties <a href="#types-of-relations" id="types-of-relations"></a>

Here are the currently available Property types within Anytype:

* **Text**: accepts text as the input.
* **Number**: for all numbers. Different formats are coming soon.
* **Date**: date, optional information for time.
* **Select:** categorical property wherein you can define a list of options to choose from, like X, Y, or Z.
* **Multi-select**: another variety of the string with no limits, only one string.
* **Email/phone/URL**: special formats for URL, email, and phone number.
* **Checkbox**: an object with a boolean, string, or link to an object.
* **File & Media**: audio, movies, or pictures which you can view, play, or download.
* **Object**: reference to a specific object, like a person, task, or document.

### Managing Properties

You can also manage the Properties for a given Object via its **Properties Panel:** the bullet list icon that appears in the top right corner of the screen. This Panel shows all Properties for that Object.

The Properties icon lets you view the properties of a specific object, while the Set up menu allows you to manage the properties of its Type â€“ you can add, remove and organize them into different sections:

* Header properties appear in the header part of every object of that Type
* Panel properties are those that will be shown by pressing Properties icon
* Hidden properties live under the "Hidden" toggle
* Local properties are those that are not associated with the Object's Type
