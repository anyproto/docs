# Vault

A **Vault** is an encrypted box stored on your device, which holds your information. It allows you to send, receive, and store information with full privacy and ownership over what you create.

All the [space.md](space.md "mention") you create and share will be stored in your Vault. Because public key cryptography is used to secure your Vault, it is unbreakable - all computational resources on earth are not enough to break into one Vault.

In order to enter your Vault, you will need to use the [key.md](key.md "mention") that was generated along with your Vault when you created it for the first time.
