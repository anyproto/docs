# Spaces

Inside your Vault, you have **Spaces**. A **Space** is a container for your graph of objects.

Similar to vault, space is an encrypted container. Unlike your Vault - each space has unique access rights - you can decide who has access to each space.

Youâ€™re able to create multiple separate spaces (up to 50), each with their own graph of objects, widget sidebar, and later on - privacy settings. You can have up to 3 shared spaces depending on your [membership](../../advanced/monetization.md) plan.

{% hint style="danger" %}
It's currently impossible to recover deleted spaces unless you've previously exported them, so be careful when deleting them.
{% endhint %}

You can navigate between your existing spaces by using the new spaces sidebar. To create a new space, simply click on the plus button at the bottom of the list.

Click on the space widget at the top of your sidebar to customize your [space-settings.md](../../advanced/settings/space-settings.md "mention") or delete your space.
