# Spaces

Inside your Vault, you have **Spaces**. A **Space** is a container for your graph of objects.

Similar to vault, space is an encrypted container. Unlike your Vault - each space has unique access rights - you can decide who has access to each space.

Youâ€™re able to create multiple separate spaces (up to 50), each with their own graph of objects, widget sidebar, and later on - privacy settings.

{% hint style="danger" %}
It's currently impossible to recover deleted spaces unless you've previously exported them, so be careful when deleting them.
{% endhint %}

You can navigate between your existing spaces by using the new spaces sidebar. To create a new space, simply click on the plus button at the bottom of the list.

Click on the space widget at the top of your sidebar to customize your [space-settings.md](../../advanced/settings/space-settings.md "mention") or delete your space.

{% hint style="info" %}
Please note that the space name can be up to 50 characters, and the space description can be up to 200 characters.
