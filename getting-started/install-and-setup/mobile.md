# Mobile

For mobile devices, you'll need to visit either the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/anytype-the-everything-app/id6449487029) (iOS) or [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.anytype.app\&amp%3Bhl=es) (Android).

You can also find the .apk files in our [GitHub](https://github.com/anyproto/anytype-kotlin/releases) repository.&#x20;

### Create a Vault or Login

The process is almost the same as on the desktop, so you can just follow the instructions from [.](./ "mention").

#### Log-in using the QR code

In addition to using your [key.md](key.md "mention") to log in, you can also use the QR code to login faster if your desktop is close by.

To log in using the QR code, simply navigate to your Key.

`Settings > Vault & Key > Key`

Beneath your Key you'll find your blurred out QR code. Clicking the image will display it.

Now you can scan this code with your mobile device and login or install the app.
