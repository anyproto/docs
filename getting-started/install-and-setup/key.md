# Key

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (6).png" alt="" width="563"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

When you create your vault, you will receive your very own 12 word mnemonic phrase. This phrase is generated on-device and is the only way to access your vault and decrypt your data.

Your Key functions as your login and passphrase at the same time. This mnemonic represents your master key generated upon signup, similar to a Bitcoin wallet.

Changing it is impossible, and it's extremely important you keep it safe. You can access it at any time by navigating to the Key section in your [account-and-data.md](../../advanced/settings/account-and-data.md "mention").

### Don't forget to save it!

We do not save a copy of your key, which means that if it's lost, we are not able to assist with recovering your vault. For this reason, we recommend making a digital backup or writing it down and keeping it somewhere safe.

You will need this key each time you login on a new device.

### If you've lost your Key

Encrypted apps work in a way that puts the responsibility for your personal data entirely in your hands. Since these apps are completely anonymous, we can't identify or delete individual Vaults. Even if we could, we wouldn't be able to verify with certainty if we're talking to the actual Vault owner or someone else.

If you've been logged out of Anytype, and haven't stored your Key somewhere else, you only have two options to recover your Key:

1. If you're still logged in on another device, you might still be able to restore your Vault. Just open the app there and copy the Key from your settings.
2. You can also try recovering your Key from your [OS Key storage manager](../../advanced/help/faqs/#how-to-recover-my-key-from-my-os-key-storage-manager).&#x20;
