If you haven't created a vault yet, you can easily create one by clicking on `I am new here` and then following the provided instructions.

**Language:** If you would like to use a language other than English for the interface, you can select it in the top right corner.

#### Save your Key!

{% hint style="danger" %}
Make sure you store your [key.md](vault-and-key/key.md "mention") somewhere safe, and try not to share it with anyone who can't be trusted!

### Log-in using your Key

On the contrary, if you already have a vault, click on `I already have a Key` and enter your [key.md](vault-and-key/key.md "mention") to proceed.

#### Log-in using the QR code

In addition to using your [key.md](vault-and-key/key.md "mention") to log in, you can also use the QR code to login faster if your desktop is close by.

To log in using the QR code, simply navigate to [#login-key](../advanced/settings/account-and-data.md#login-key "mention") in your Vault Settings.
