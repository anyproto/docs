# Blocks

Your object is made up of different types of blocks to organize your information, and the place where all of these Blocks live together is called the Canvas. Anytype's block-based editor works very similarly to that of blogging sites or website builders.

All block styles originate from the command menu, which you can access by either clicking on the orange `+` symbol on the left-hand side of your editor, or typing `/`.&#x20;

### Style your Blocks

You can select one block or several at once, and batch edit to create different headings and text styles such as checkboxes, bullets, or numbers.

### Inline Styling &#x20;

We also support styling individual characters / words inside text blocks.

### Columns

You can use the grey 'handle' to the left of each block to create parent/child blocks or new columns in your editor by dragging and dropping them.
