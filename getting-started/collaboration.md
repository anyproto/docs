# Collaboration

In the Space Settings menu of each space you’ve created, you’ll now see the option to `Share Space` in your Space settings. By clicking here, you can generate an invite link for the Space, which can be sent to anyone.

Once they click the link and request to join your Space, you’ll receive a notification prompting you to add this person as an Editor, Viewer, or to reject the request entirely. Editors have edit access to all objects within the Space, while Viewers have read-only access to all objects within the space.

As a Space owner, it is possible to share up to three Spaces at this time. You can manage the roles of guests you have invited to your Space, or remove them altogether. Guests who have been removed from a space will receive a notification that they have been removed from the Space, and will see an option to export the contents of the Space.

## FAQ

<details>

<summary>How do I create a shared space?</summary>

![](<../.gitbook/assets/Space Settings_Shared Space Creation.png>)

Each newly Space you create is _Private_ by default. In the Space settings menu, you’ll see the option to ‘Share’. This will create a share link that you can send to anyone you would like to join your space. At this point, the Space becomes a _Shared_ Space.&#x20;

<summary>What access control settings are available in my shared spaces? </summary>

When you create a shared space you are the Space Owner. The Space Owner can change any object in the space, the space name and settings, and is the only one with rights to add and remove members.

Members of the Space have either Viewer or Editor rights. Viewers have read-only access to the Space, while Editors can edit any object in the Space or the Space Name.&#x20;

<summary>How do I invite people to my space?</summary>

![](<../.gitbook/assets/Anytype Space Sharing_Invite Link.png>)

As a Space owner, once you click 'Share Space' in your space settings, you can generate a shareable invite link. Anyone who you send this link to, can request access to your space.&#x20;

When a new user requests access to your space, you can approve or deny the request and set their access to 'Editor' or 'Viewer'.

<summary>How does the invite link work?</summary>

When clicking your invite link, guests who have already installed Anytype will see a popup confirmation screen asking if they would like to join your space. Upon clicking ‘Request to Join’, you will receive a notification for a join request from \[Guest Profile name] to your shared space.

If your guest has never installed Anytype, the invite link will open a unique download page with instructions for installing the application. After having done so, they would need to click the invite link again, which will open the ‘Request to Join’ confirmation popup.
