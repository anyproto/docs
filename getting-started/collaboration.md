# Collaboration

You can now find the Members submenu in the Space Settings menu of each space youâ€™ve created. Clicking here allows you to generate an invite link for the space that can be sent to anyone.

There are three types of invitation link: Editor, Viewer, and Request Access. The first two allow users to join the space directly with specific access, eliminating the need for confirmation by the owner. The third type enables the owner to select the desired level of access after the user has requested it.

When you create a shared space you are the Space Owner. The Space Owner can change any object in the space, the space name and settings, and is the only one with rights to add and remove members.

All other members of the Space have either Viewer or Editor rights. Viewers have read-only access to the Space, while Editors can edit any object in the Space or the Space Name.&#x20;

From the same menu, you can manage the roles of guests you have invited to your Space or remove them altogether. Guests who have been removed from a Space will receive a notification informing them of this.
