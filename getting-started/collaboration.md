# Collaboration

You can now find the Members submenu in the Channel Settings menu of each channel you’ve created. Clicking here allows you to generate an invite link for the channel that can be sent to anyone.

There are three types of invitation link: Editor, Viewer, and Request Access. The first two allow users to join the channel directly with specific access, eliminating the need for confirmation by the owner. The third type enables the owner to select the desired level of access after the user has requested it.

When you create a shared channel you are the Channel Owner. The Channel Owner can change any object in the channel, the channel name and settings, and is the only one with rights to add and remove members.

All other members of the Channel have either Viewer or Editor rights. Viewers have read-only access to the Channel, while Editors can edit any object in the Channel or the Channel Name.

From the same menu, you can manage the roles of guests you have invited to your Channel or remove them altogether. Guests who have been removed from a Channel will receive a notification informing them of this.
