# Chats in spaces?

Breaking news: Anytype is becoming Anytype’s main workspace.

With this release, we’ve started moving all our team communication into a Slack-like format inside Anytype – and it’s stirred up both excitement and a little creative chaos, the kind that means things are moving fast. There’s something surreal and satisfying about building a chat experience while using that same chat to debate its details.

This update continues our work on Chats: now as native Objects within your Space Channel. You can create multiple topic-based conversations and connect them directly to the work they’re about. It’s one more step toward making communication feel as structured and interconnected as your knowledge.

We’re also reworking how navigation feels across channels, making it lighter, more consistent and compact.

And yes, there’s more to come. Some of you might remember our previous multi moment – the launch of Multiplayer Mode on Product Hunt, our first steps into real-time collaboration. Now, we’re doing “multi” again – this time, multi-chats. We’ll share more soon and keep you posted on what’s next at the upcoming Town Hall.

As always, your thoughts and feedback mean the world!

Anton’s suggestion:\
Chats now live as native Objects in your Spaces, so you can spin up topic-based threads and link them directly to your work. Navigation across channels is now lighter and more consistent.\
And yes, the “multi” era continues — after Multiplayer Mode, we’re rolling out multi-chats.\
As always, your feedback fuels us — for better or worse.\
Multi-Chats in your Space\
Space Channels now hold more than one conversation at a time. Start topic-specific chats right where your work happens – discussions now live alongside your notes, tasks, and documentation as part of your knowledge graph.

Chat as an Object Type\
Chats are now native Objects in your Space. You can:\
Rename them and assign icons\
Organize them into views (including Kanban)\
Use tags to connect related conversations or other Objects\
Search for chats like any other Object\
Include chats in Collections or Queries\
@-mention chats from any Object for cross-referencing\
As a system Type, Chat doesn’t support templates or layout changes.\
Widget Behaviour\
The Chats Type widget works like any other widget. You can:\
Pin Chats to your sidebar.\
Adjust widget appearance – choose how many chats to show and whether to include message previews (with a list view).\
Pin individual chats for quicker access.\
What makes it different from other widgets:\
Pinned chat widgets display unread counters and mention indicators, helping you track new activity directly from the sidebar.\
A temporary Unread section appears automatically when new messages arrive, listing chats with unread content.\
Per-Chat Notifications\
Right-click any Chat Object, or use the three-dots menu inside a chat window to open preferences and choose Enable all, Mentions only, or Disable all.
