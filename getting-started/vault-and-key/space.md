# Channels

Inside your Vault, you have **Channels**. A **Channel** is a container for your graph of objects.

Similar to a vault, a channel is an encrypted container. Unlike your vault, each channel has unique access rights, you can decide who has access to each channel.

You’re able to create multiple separate channels, each with their own graph of objects, sidebar, and privacy settings.

It's currently impossible to recover deleted channels unless you've previously exported them, so be careful when deleting them.
{% endhint %}

Use the vault sidebar to navigate between your existing channels.

To create a new channel, simply click on the plus button in the top right corner of the channels sidebar:

If you would like to customize or delete your channel, please take a look at [space-settings.md](../../advanced/settings/space-settings.md "mention").
