# Collections

### Understanding Collections

These are similar to Sets in their appearance and layout, however functioning differently.

Contrary to Sets and what was explained in the previous chapter, Collections are not filtered by Object Type but are in fact open to any Type.&#x20;

Collections can be used to organize a variety of different objects and store them in one place.

You are not restricted to viewing only one Object Type at a time, this means you can have multiple different types within one collection.&#x20;

### Example

If you are organizing your meal prep for the week, you might have a list of recipes, as well as ingredients and a shopping list.&#x20;

The main types you may have could be Recipes and Ingredients.&#x20;

In a Collection, you can organize all of this Types together seamlessly.&#x20;
