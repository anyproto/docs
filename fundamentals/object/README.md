# Object

People, Books, Musicians, Documents, Ideas, Places, Numbers, or Files. In Anytype these are all "objects". For instance, a person named "Enda," an essay to write, the music by "Pink Floyd," the film "2001", a town called "Berlin," a year, or just a simple status like "Done". **Everything** inside Anytype is an Object, including the other fundamental concepts [relation.md](../relation.md "mention"), [type](../type/ "mention"), and [set.md](../set.md "mention"). All are types of Objects. The _contents_ of objects are Blocks, which you can read more about below.

### How to create objects?

### Object Canvas

Every object has a flexible editing area that we call the "canvas". The canvas contains "blocks", each of which is a piece of information that you can freely move around the canvas. Blocks can take many forms and enable a wide variety of functionality and design adjustments, including text color and highlighting, alignment, and more. You can add a new blocks to hold any information you like by hitting the `+` button or do so in-line by typing `/`. Hover over a block to see its size or move it elsewhere on the canvas. To create a column, drag one block alongside another block.

### **Object Layout**

Layouts help you customize how your object looks. For example, you can align your text blocks, change the icon type, or set the page full-width.

**Anytype currently supports three kinds of layout:**

1. **Basic:** a classic view for notes, articles, and docs.
2. **Profile:** designed for contacts, people, and organizations.
3. **Action:** for getting things done. Perfect for tasks and plans.

We have designed layouts to be extendable. In the future, users will be able to make custom layouts too!

{% hint style="info" %}
Primary and Profile layouts support either an emoji or a photo icon. All layouts, except Note, support a cover image.
