# Set

Bring multiple objects into one view with Sets. You can make a Set for a specific type of object, like seeing every task in one view. Inside a Set, you can sort, filter, and choose a view.

Sets don't **store** objects like the regular databases. They are a way to see a portion of your knowledge graph that match given criterion, like **Type** == **Task**. So can add a new Task object anywhere inside the Anytype, and it will be shown in **Task Set**!. Sets help you sort through and create specific database-like views to work with many objects at once.

## **Create a Set**

You can create a Set with a + menu in the Home or bottom-left corner or in / menu in editor. After that you need to decide on what you want to see there. For example project management may require Project type, for reading list — Book.
