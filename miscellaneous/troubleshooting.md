# Troubleshooting

If you get an error, you can try these steps before checking the [forum](https://community.anytype.io/) or contacting [support](mailto:support@anytype.io).

1. Ensure that the time on your computer is correct. If the local time is more than 2 hours off, a connection might not be possible.
2. Check if you’re using a proxy, VPN, firewall, or a company network to connect. If yes, try connecting without these to see if it makes a difference.
3. Attempt the connection outside of corporate networks or similar setups.
4. Use your mobile device as a Wi-Fi hotspot for your desktop and try connecting through that.
5. Try to Log in from another device (& network).
6. For iOS users, check if the sync status turns green. If not, attempt connecting from different networks.
7. If you are having graphical issues, try deleting the GPUCache folder under \~/.config/anytype.
