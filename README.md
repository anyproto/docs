# Welcome

Anytype is an **encrypted, local-first alternative** to the cloud-based Internet.

With Anytype, you can build digital [space.md](getting-started/vault-and-key/space.md "mention") around your interests. These spaces can be personal - for diaries, ideas and drafts, or shared - with your family, small communities, teams, neighbors and people with similar interests.

You can now also connect through [chats.md](getting-started/vault-and-key/chats.md "mention"), which make it easy to hold conversations inside your spaces. Chats live alongside your notes, documents, and media, so discussions stay private and contextually linked to the things you care about.

Unlike cloud applications, Anytype puts the control of encryption keys firmly in your hands, so you own your data and your social graph. Spaces you create are local first - they can be created offline and can sync peer-to-peer in local networks.

Anytype is supported by [AnySync](https://tech.anytype.io/any-sync/overview) - an open-source protocol that supports high-performant collaboration over encrypted data and creatorsâ€™ controlled keys. You can find our codebase [here](https://github.com/anyproto).

With every architectural choice, we aim to make [fundamental digital freedoms](https://youtu.be/6Hyr881Xi8A?si=tVftb8x9V5koMt0U) unconditional. Here you can read more of our thoughts on[ cloud vs. local first Internet.](https://blog.anytype.io/from-cloud-to-local-first/)
