## Intro

Anytype is a local-first, E2E encrypted software designed as a secure place to create and store digital assets.

You can use Anytype to create and connect your tasks, notes, ideas, documents, workflows, and more.

Future versions will allow you to share your work and safely collaborate with others. Our long-term vision is for Anytype to enable large-scale collaboration to create a global repository of interconnected knowledge.

Explore the documentation here to learn more about using the product, troubleshooting your account, and data privacy.

{% hint style="info" %}
There's no browser version of the app. Anytype is a stand-alone software, that works on desktop or mobile devices. There are many points of vulnerability in-browser apps that would compromise our commitment to data security and encryption.
