# Membership Plans

Our memberships are designed to reflect the same core principles that have always guided Anytype’s development: unrestricted access to our software and an open ecosystem where contributions are fairly rewarded.

Here, we describe the first version of our memberships, launching in Spring 2024. For more information about the philosophy behind our membership and its planned evolution, please visit this blog post: [Our Membership Philosophy](https://blog.anytype.io/our-memberships-philosophy/).

## Membership Model & Plans

Once memberships are launched, all users of Anytype will fall into one of the below categories:

1. **Non-members:** Those who have not purchased or earned a membership
2. **Members:** Those who have purchased or earned a membership.
   * Explorers
   * Builders
   * Co-Creators
3. **Guests of Members:** Those who have been invited to a shared space in the Anytype network by a current Member.

### **Non-Members**

This is the default for newly onboarded users who have not been invited to a shared space by a current Anytype user.&#x20;

_All members and non-members have unrestricted access to the following:_

* On-device, local-only storage
* P2P sync
* Zero-knowledge encryption

### **Members**

There are three membership plans for the Anytype Network:

* One ‘default’ space
* Up to 3 shared spaces&#x20;
  * Each shared space is limited to 3 Editors (Owner + 2 invited Editors per space)

_\*Beta testers - those who joined before the launch of multiplayer in April 2024 - will automatically receive an Explorer membership, regardless of whether they’ve previously submitted their e-mail. Storage limits previously applied to your account will not change._&#x20;

* Part of our [Community forum](https://community.anytype.io)

## Pricing for Contributors

Those who are active contributors to our codebase, gallery, tutorials, and community will have a one-year Builder membership subsidized. Active contributions are defined as 2+ contributions in the past year. You can check the status of your contributions [here](https://github.com/anyproto/contributors/blob/main/contributors.json).&#x20;

Other contributors, who have not met the threshold of 2 contributions per year, can purchase a one-year Builder Plan at 50% discount.&#x20;

We will be sending communications specifically for contributors, announcing the launch of memberships with instructions for claiming your contributor discount. If you haven’t already signed up, the form for our contributors’ mailing list can be found [here](https://anytype.io/contributors?popup=contribute).&#x20;

If you believe that your contribution status is incorrect, please write us at support@anytype.io.&#x20;

## Pricing for Self-Hosters

Self-hosters can manage the limits of Viewers/Editors they invite to their Spaces themselves. Those who would like to purchase a name in the Anytype naming system or access priority support, can purchase a membership at the same price as other beta testers.&#x20;

In the future, we will introduce membership discounts for self-hosters. For those who would like to support the network in the meantime, we will have an option for donations.
