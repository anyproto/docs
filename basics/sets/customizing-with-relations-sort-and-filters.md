# Customizing with Relations, Sort, & Filters

### Toggle & Add Relations to Objects via Sets

Instead of adding Relations one-by-one to Objects, you can batch-add them to your Set by clicking the filters on the right side.

Here you can toggle on/off any Relations that you would like to see, add another Relation or new relation, and edit the View of the Set here.

You can add any Relations to be automatically added to your **Objects**, by adding them in the creation process of your **Type**.

See more about how to [create-a-new-type.md](../types/create-a-new-type.md "mention") here. Underneath the title & Template section of the new Type process you'll have the Relation options.

### Sorts & Filters

You are also able to sort or filter your set by any relation that you've previously added to the Set.
