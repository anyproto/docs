# Relations

### Understanding Relations <a href="#understanding-relations" id="understanding-relations"></a>

Relations are key to organizing and connecting your Objects and knowledge in Anytype. There are two functions that Relations serve in Anytype:

* **Defining attributes:** You can use Relations to define the characteristics of a certain Object.
  * For example, when creating a Task in Anytype, you can add Relations such as _Status_: Done/Not Done, or _Priority_: Low, Medium, or High.
  * If we were to imagine a database, Relations represent the column headers to each row (where column A represents the Object name, and where each row represents an Object).
  * Once you have set your attributes, it becomes possible to sort and filter your Objects according to the Relations you've defined in Set View.

* **Defining connections:** You can also use Relations to link one Object to another.
  * Returning to the example of a Task, you can add the Relation: _Assignee,_ and assign another Object in your Anytype to this task.
  * As above, you can view the Assignees as Relations in Set view, or in Graph view.
