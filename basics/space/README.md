Inside your Vault, you have **Spaces**. A **Space** is a container for your graph of objects.

Similar to vault, space is an encrypted container. Unlike your Vault - each space has unique access rights - you can decide who has access to each space.

Youâ€™re able to create multiple separate spaces (up to 10), each with their own graph of objects, widget sidebar, and later on - privacy settings. You can have up to 3 shared spaces depending on your [membership](../../memberships/monetization/) plan.

{% hint style="info" %}
Keep in mind that you are currently not able to delete nor share your initial Entry Space.
{% endhint %}

Simply click your profile picture to create new spaces, or navigate between existing ones.

Use the [space management menu](space-settings.md) at the top of your sidebar to customize your space settings or delete your space.

You can also manage all of your spaces by going into `Settings >` [`Spaces`](space-settings.md).
