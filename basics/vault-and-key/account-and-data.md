**Automatically show and hide sidebar:** With this option disabled the sidebar won't automatically pop out when you hover over the left side of the screen.

### Pin Code

{% hint style="info" %}
This feature is currently available only on desktop.
{% endhint %}

If you want more privacy, like when sharing a computer, you can set up a PIN code. This will lock the app and keep your Key safe. You'll just need to enter the PIN each time your Anytype session ends (after 1 minute, 5 minutes, 10 minutes, or 1 hour) or when you need to access your Key.

{% hint style="warning" %}
We do not store this data so we cannot help you in recovering your vault in the case it is lost. Make sure to write down your pin code next to your Key.
{% endhint %}

### Spaces

You can also manage all of your spaces by going into `Settings > Spaces`.

### Data Management

**Local Files:** You can choose to offload files stored in Anytype to our Encrypted Backup Node.

**Data Location:** You can also decide where your data is stored (desktop only).

**Vault Deletion:** Also, if you would like to delete your vault, you can do it in this section.

### Key

You can access your Key or scan the QR code to connect your mobile device. For more details, please check [what-is-a-recovery-phrase.md](../../data-and-security/what-is-a-recovery-phrase.md "mention").
