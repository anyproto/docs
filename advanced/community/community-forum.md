Report Bugs

### Squash that bug!

Experiencing something weird? Tell the team and let's get it solved. We want this application to be as spotless as possible.

When creating a bug report on the Community Forum, you'll be presented with template which will give our team the precise information necessary to comprehend the issue. We kindly ask you to please follow this format as explicitly as you can.

Providing a clear and accurate explanation of the bug you encountered will assist our Mods and Nightly Ops team in reproducing the issue. This will establish that the problem is widespread and should be escalated to our dev team for more immediate attention.

### Request a Feature & Vote

This is the place to post, contribute to, & vote for all things related to feature requests & new feature development!&#x20;

We prioritize our building agenda based on what is most desired by our community.&#x20;

So if there is something you want to see happen, go out and vote for it!

Beware! Search for a topic before, see if it already exists _before_ adding a new recommendation. You wouldn't want to be that guy...
