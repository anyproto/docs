<summary>What happened to the old homepage?</summary>

<img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/w=3840,quality=80 (1).webp" alt="" data-size="original">

The homepage from the alpha app has been removed, and replaced with the new sidebar and widgets. If you really liked this layout, you can try recreating it using a set with a gallery view or you can try this [gallery experience](https://gallery.any.coop/Made%20by%20Any?experience=legacy_homepage).

<summary>Why do I have an Entry Space?</summary>

Vaults created before version 0.44.0 have an Entry Space. You are free to delete this space if no longer needed, or you can migrate your data to a different space by using the [import-export](../../data-and-security/import-export/ "mention") feature.
