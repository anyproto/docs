### Pre-Alpha

* These were the early days of Anytype during which the team was looking for potential investors after they've developed the initial vision for the app.
* This phase started sometime in 2019, and by 2020 the plans for the app were already public.

### Alpha

* The alpha phase started around June 2020 when the first users started testing the app.
* Users who signed up during this stage and helped us test and improve the app, get 10GB of storage for free and the alpha flair on the community forum.
* The app used during this time is now referred to as the legacy app.

### Beta (current)

* The first beta release was 0.32.0 and it was released on 15 June 2023. Alpha users who wanted to keep their data needed to migrate to the new app.
* The official open beta launch was on 19 July 2023.

### Public Release

* There is currently no ETA for the public release.
* You can check our progress towards it through our [public roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/anyproto/projects/1/views/1).
