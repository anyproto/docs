# Memberships

Our memberships are designed to reflect the same core principles that have always guided Anytypeâ€™s development: unrestricted access to our software and an open ecosystem where contributions are fairly rewarded.

For more information about the philosophy behind our membership and its planned evolution, please visit this blog post: [Our Membership Philosophy](https://blog.anytype.io/our-memberships-philosophy/).

This offer is only available to beta users who joined our community prior to the launch of memberships. Additionally, these discount codes can only be used once, and the subscription will revert to the standard rate once it has been renewed.

## Pricing for Contributors

Those who are active contributors to our codebase, gallery, tutorials, and community will have a one-year Builder membership subsidized. Active contributions are defined as 2+ contributions in the past year. You can check the status of your contributions [here](https://github.com/anyproto/contributors/blob/main/contributors.json).

Other contributors, who have not met the threshold of 2 contributions per year, can purchase a one-year Builder Plan at 50% discount.

To request your contributor's discount code, please email us at [association@anytype.io](mailto:association@anytype.io).&#x20;

If you believe that your contribution status is incorrect, please write us at [association@anytype.io](mailto:association@anytype.io).

## Pricing for Self-Hosters

Self-hosters can manage the limits of Viewers/Editors they invite to their Spaces themselves. Those who would like to purchase a name in the Anytype naming system or access priority support, can purchase a membership at the same price as other beta testers.

In the future, we will introduce membership discounts for self-hosters. For those who would like to support the network in the meantime, we welcome your donation [here](https://stripe.pay.anytype.io/b/4gw0337MrdvbejK28f) (thank you!).
