# Data Erasure

Since we don't have access to your Anytype data, and we have no way to connect your Anytype ID to your email address, there is no way for us to delete your data. This means that you can only delete it yourself, and through the app.

### Delete or Reset Your Vault / Account

In the top menu, Click "Anytype", open Settings, Data management, and select **Delete vault.** This will delete your profile, and your Key:

If you would like to create a new vault instead, do the following:

1. `Anytype > Settings > Vault > Data management > Delete vault`
2. `Anytype > Settings > Vault > Log Out`
3. Click: “_**Join**_” (instead of "Log in")

### Other Data

For everything else (forum posts, support tickets, and email subscriptions), please contact us at [support@anytype.io](mailto:support@anytype.io), and we'll delete these for you.
