Before permanently deleting your objects, you'll first need to move them to the bin.&#x20;

To permanently delete your objects, you will first need to locate and open the Bin. You can find the it at the bottom of your sidebar.

After opening the Bin, if you would still like to permanently delete some of your objects, you will first need to select them, and then you can click on the `Delete permanently` button to get rid of them forever.

You can use the same process to restore your objects instead.
