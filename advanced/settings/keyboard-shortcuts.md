# Keyboard Shortcuts

We've expanded the number of actions available for keyboard shortcuts, giving you more control than ever before.

* Re-assignable Shortcuts: Most shortcuts can be customized, while some remain fixed.
* Dual Key Combos: Certain actions support two different key combinations for added flexibility.
* Import/Export Mappings: Easily back up or transfer your shortcut configurations.
* Categories: Shortcuts are grouped into different categories for better navigation.
