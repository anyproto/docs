#### Appearance

**Set color mode:** Choose between light, dark or auto color modes.

#### Editor Personalization&#x20;

#### **Language & Spelling**

**Spellcheck Languages:** You can enable automatic spellcheck from 40+ languages, or disable the spellcheck.

**Interface Language:** You can choose amongst the community-translated versions to localize your interface.

#### Date & Time

**Date & Time formats**: Here you are able to choose which date and time formats you want to use across your whole vault.

**Use relative dates:** You can decide whether you want relative dates like today / tomorrow to be used, or whether you want all dates to show the exact date.

**Week starts on**: You can now choose whether your week starts on Sunday or Monday. Head to your updated settings to make the switch in the date-picker.

### Pin Code (Desktop)

If you want more privacy, like when sharing a computer, you can set up a PIN code. This will lock the app and keep your Key safe. You'll just need to enter the PIN each time your Anytype session ends (after 1 minute, 5 minutes, 10 minutes, or 1 hour) or when you need to access your Key.

{% hint style="warning" %}
We do not store this data so we cannot help you in recovering your vault in the case it is lost. Make sure to write down your pin code next to your Key.
