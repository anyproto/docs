## Profile

Here you can add your **name, bio,** and **profile picture.** Your profile represents an Object in your Anytype Graph which you can freely link to other Objects.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (27).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

#### Appearance

**Set color mode:** Choose between light, dark or auto color modes.

#### Editor Personalization

**Open objects in fullscreen:** You can decide whether you want all objects to be opened in fullscreen by default.

#### App Appearance

**Link to object style:** You can decide which style should the /link command use by default (either card or text).

**Automatically show and hide sidebar:** With this option disabled the sidebar won't automatically pop out when you hover over the left side of the screen.

**Show Anytype in system tray:** Anytype will always stay running in the background, but you have the option to either have it show in the system tray or not.

**Show menu bar:** This setting will show the default menu bar for your OS.

### Language & Region

#### **Language & Spelling**

**Spellcheck Languages:** You can enable automatic spellcheck from 40+ languages, or disable the spellcheck.

**Interface Language:** You can choose amongst the community-translated versions to localize your interface.

#### Date & Time

**Date & Time formats**: Here you are able to choose which date and time formats you want to use across your whole vault.

**Use relative dates:** You can decide whether you want relative dates like today / tomorrow to be used, or whether you want all dates to show the exact date.

**Week starts on**: You can now choose whether your week starts on Sunday or Monday. Head to your updated settings to make the switch in the date-picker.

### Pin Code (Desktop)

If you want more privacy, like when sharing a computer, you can set up a PIN code. This will lock the app and keep your Key safe. You'll just need to enter the PIN each time your Anytype session ends (after 1 minute, 5 minutes, 10 minutes, or 1 hour) or when you need to access your Key.

{% hint style="warning" %}
We do not store this data so we cannot help you in recovering your vault in the case it is lost. Make sure to write down your pin code next to your Key.
