# Graph

{% hint style="warning" %}
Available on desktop only.
{% endhint %}

From anywhere in the app, you'll see the graph icon at the top and next to your sidebar:

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (105).png" alt="" width="375"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

In the Graph you can see which Objects are connected together, and the direction everything flows.

On the top right of the screen in your Graph, you can **search** and optimize some settings.&#x20;

Toggle appearances for title, arrows, and icons.&#x20;

Optimize viewing links, Properties, and unlinked objects. **If you are missing some objects, check to show unlinked objects.**
