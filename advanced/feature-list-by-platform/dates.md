You can open any date as a separate object and view the entire context related to that date.

This includes [mentions (@date)](../../getting-started/object-editor/linking-objects.md#date-mentions), automatically created dates and custom date properties.

Date is also accessible from properties, layouts, graph, calendar view and more.
