### Pre-Alpha

* These were the early days of Anytype during which the team was looking for potential investors after they've developed the initial vision for the app.
* This phase started sometime in 2019, and by 2020 the plans for the app were already public.

### Alpha

* The alpha phase started around June 2020 when the first users started testing the app.
* Users who signed up during this stage and helped us test and improve the app, get 10GB of storage for free and the alpha flair on the community forum.
* The app used during this time is now referred to as the legacy app.

### Beta (current)

* The first beta release was 0.32.0 and it was released on 15 June 2023. Alpha users who wanted to keep their data needed to migrate to the new app.
* The official open beta launch was on on 19 July 2023.
* Users who sign up during this stage and helped us test and improve the app, will get extra 1GB of storage for free and the beta flair on the community forum.

### Public Release

* There is currently no ETA for when the public release is supposed to happen. Presumably, this can only happen after all the collaboration features are released.
* You can check the progress towards our public release through our [public roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/anyproto/projects/1/views/1).
